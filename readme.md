# Authentication Administrator Helper PowerShell Module

The Authentication Administrator Helper PowerShell module includes additional functions that might be required by help-desk/admins managing MFA settings for users. These cmdlets add functionality that is not currently included in the Azure AD Portal.

Download the [Module](authadmin.psm1) to a local folder. The module requires the [MSOnline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/msonline/?view=azureadps-1.0) and the [Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0) (version 2.0.2 or higher) PowerShell modules to be already installed.

Check the [User Guide](Docs/AuthAdmin-UserGuide.md) for the full documentation.
