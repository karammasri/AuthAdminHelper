# User Guide

The Authentication Administrator Helper PowerShell module includes additional functions that might be required by help-desk/admins managing MFA settings for users. These cmdlets add functionality that is not currently included in the Azure AD Portal.

## Pre-requisites

This modules uses functions in the [MSOnline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/msonline/?view=azureadps-1.0) PowerShell module.

The MSOnline module can be downloaded and installed from the PowerShell gallery using:

```powershell
Install-Module MSOnline
```

## Importing the Authentication Administrator Helper PowerShell module

Open PowerShell, change to the folder where the module file was downloaded and import the module using:

```powershell
Import-Module .\authadmin.psm1
```

The module can also be [implicitly imported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/developer/module/importing-a-powershell-module#implicitly-importing-a-module-powershell-30) by PowerShell if stored in a folder that is in the `PSModulePath` environment variable.

## Authenticating to Azure AD

An authentication prompt will be displayed the first time a function is called that requires connectivity to Azure AD. Additional calls to functions in the module will not require re-authentication once the first authentication succeeds.

The authentication prompt relies on the `Connect-MSOLService` function provided by the MSOnline module. Any conditional access policies that apply when calling `Connect-MSOLService` will then also apply to users using this module (e.g. MFA).

### Permissions required by the user using the module

The user calling the functions in this module should be a member of one of the following [Azure AD administrative roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles):

- Global Administrator
- Authentication Administrator
- Privileged Authentication Administrator

Assignments to these roles can be managed using [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure). The user will need to complete [activation of the role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-activate-role) before using this module.

The module relies on the permissions granted over the target user objects in the tenant by the Azure AD administrative role that the calling user is member of. There are no special additional permissions granted by this module.

## Functions to manage MFA settings on a User

### Get the MFA authentication methods for a user

Run the following command to get the MFA authentication methods for a user:

```powershell
Get-MFAUserAuthenticationMethods -UserPrincipalName <UPN>
```

Where:

- `<UPN>` is the User Principal Name of the user. The command accepts only one User Principal Name per call.

The output will show the authentication methods registered for the user. Methods not registered are not listed.

The methods are shown using the aliases described in [MFA Methods aliases](#mfa-methods-aliases).

A second column named IsDefault is added to the output. The column will contain the value “True” for the default authentication method and “False” for all the other methods.

### Change the default MFA authentication method for a user

Run the following command to change the default MFA authentication method for a user:

```powershell
Set-MFAUserDefaultAuthenticationMethod -UserPrincipalName <UPN> -Method <MethodAlias>
```

Where:

- `<UPN>` is the User Principal Name of the user. The command accepts only one User Principal Name per call
- `<Method>` is the alias of MFA authentication method to set as default for the user as listed in [MFA Methods aliases](#mfa-methods-aliases). PowerShell tab completion can be used to cycle through the possible values.

The user should have already registered this method for the change to take effect. An error is shown if the user doesn’t have the selected method registered.

### Reset the MFA authentication methods for a user

Run the following command to reset the MFA authentication methods for a user:

```powershell
Reset-MFAUserAuthenticationMethods -UserPrincipalName <UPN>
```

Where:

-`<UPN>` is the User Principal Name of the user. The command accepts only one User Principal Name per call.

The cmdlet has an [confirm impact](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_preference_variables?view=powershell-6#confirmpreference) of "High" and will request confirmation before committing changes.

### Disabling per-user MFA for a user

This cmdlet can be used to disable per-user MFA without loosing registered methods.

Run the following command to disable per-user MFA for a user:

```powershell
Disable-PerUserMFA -UserPrincipalName <UPN> [-RemoveMethods]
```

Where:

- `<UPN>` is the User Principal Name of the user to disable per-user MFA for. The command accepts only one User Principal Name per call.
- `RemoveMethods` is an optional switch parameters that indicates that the currently registered MFA methods by the user should also be removed as part of disabling per-user MFA. By default the currently registered MFA methods are kept unless this switch is included in the call.

Disabling per-user MFA using the Azure MFA portal also removes the authentication methods already registered by the user. This forces the user to have to re-register
the authentication methods again once a conditional access policy that requires MFA applies to the user. By using this cmdlet **without** the `RemoveMethods` switch, per-user MFA can be disabled without loosing registered MFA methods.

### Display the aliases of MFA authentication methods

Run the following command to get the aliases of the MFA authentication methods:

```powershell
Get-MFAMethodsAliases
```

The output will show the aliases as described in [MFA Methods aliases](#mfa-methods-aliases).

## Functions to manage delegation of the Authentication Administrator role on an Administrative Unit

## List the delegated Authentication Administrators on an Administrative Unit

Run the following command to get the list of delegated Authentication Administrators on an Administrative Unit

```powershell
Get-DelegatedAuthAdminsToAU -AdministrativeUnitName <AUName>
```

Where:

-`<AUName>` is the display name of the Administrative Unit to query for delegated Authentication Administrators.

## Add a delegated Authentication Administrator to an Administrative Unit

Run the following command to add a delegated Authentication Administrators to an Administrative Unit

```powershell
Add-DelegatedAuthAdminsToAU -AdministrativeUnitName <AUName> -AuthenticationAdminUPN <AuthAdminUPN>
```

Where:

- `<AUName>` is the display name of the Administrative Unit to query for delegated Authentication Administrators.
- `<AuthenticationAdminUPN>` is the user principal name of the delegated Authentication Administrator to add to the Administrative Unit

## Remove a delegated Authentication Administrator from an Administrative Unit

Run the following command to remove a delegated Authentication Administrators from an Administrative Unit

```powershell
Remove-DelegatedAuthAdminsToAU -AdministrativeUnitName <AUName> -AuthenticationAdminUPN <AuthAdminUPN>
```

Where:

- `<AUName>` is the display name of the Administrative Unit to query for delegated Authentication Administrators.
- `<AuthenticationAdminUPN>` is the user principal name of the delegated Authentication Administrator to remove from the Administrative Unit

## About the output messages

The script uses common PowerShell output cmdlets for reporting Errors, Warnings and Information ([Write-Error](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/write-error?view=powershell-6), [Write-Warning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/write-warning?view=powershell-6) and [Write-Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/write-information?view=powershell-6)).

The level of output generated depends on the settings for the [preferences variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_preference_variables?view=powershell-6) that impact these cmdlets.

For example, the [$InformationPreference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_preference_variables?view=powershell-6#informationpreference) variable is set by default to `SilentlyContinue`, which will then cause that Information level messages are not going to be sent to the screen. Modify this variable to `Continue` to get the information messages to the screen.

You can also use the [PowerShell Common Parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_commonparameters?view=powershell-6) with any of the cmdlets in this module.

## MFA Methods aliases

The module uses the following aliases to identify MFA methods:

|Alias                      |Description  |
|---------------------------|-------------|
|TwoWayVoiceMobile          | Phone call to authentication phone |
|TwoWayVoiceAlternateMobile | Phone call to alternate authentication phone |
|TwoWayVoiceOffice          | Phone call to office phone |
|OneWaySMS                  | One-time code sent via SMS message to authentication phone |
|PhoneAppOTP                | One-time code generated by the Authenticator app |
|PhoneAppNotification       | Push notification to the Authenticator app |
